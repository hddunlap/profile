        <h1>Hampton Duke Dunlap</h1>
        <div class="col-1">
          <p>My name is Hampton Duke Dunlap. I am a Los Angeles-based graphic designer working for The Workshop.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2">
          <p>I was born in Houston and raised in San Antonio, Texas. I received my high school education at Pomfret School, a boarding school in rural Connecticut. Afterwards, I went to the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina, where I received a Bachelor of Science in Economics. I also earned minors in Political Science and German, respectively.</p>

      <div class="col-3">
        <p>I have been drawing since I could pick up a pencil, and am a self-taught graphic artist and designer. I have also taught myself to write code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My German is passable, and I can speak  but I am fluent in Adobe Creative Suite.</p>
        <p>I am a coffee aficionado and an avid beer drinker. I love all sorts of music, from roots reggae to deep house. I probably spend too much time watching sports, especially basketball (long live the San Antonio Spurs) and football. I, like just about every other millennial, also like to pass time by obsessively indulging in Netflix marathons. My favorite show is Game of Thrones, with Breaking Bad, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Arrested Development receiving Honorable Mention votes. Yes, I have read all of the books. No, I do not speak Dothraki.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-4">
        <p>When I am not watching fictional dramas about medieval political struggles and CGI dragons, I am reading material on - surprise - economics and politics. I am particularly interested in global affairs, mainly because American politics are so incredibly maddening. I abhor television entertainment news, and believe that being educated and up-to-date on social and political happenings is crucial to understanding my place in the world.</p>
        <p>My passion for design is partly driven by the desire to understand and recognize the channels of human communication. and partly by some sort of low-level OCD with regards to the way things are presented. My drawing style is crude and linear, but that is what flows from my hand. And I will keep drawing until my hand falls off.</p>
